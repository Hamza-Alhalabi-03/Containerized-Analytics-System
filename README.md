# Containerized Analytics System

A modern, containerized web application for collecting and analyzing developer data. This system consists of multiple microservices working together to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly analytics platform.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Data Entry App** (Port 8080): A PHP-based web application for entering developer data
- **Authentication Service** (Port 8081): Handles user authentication and session management
- **Analytics Service**: Processes and analyzes the collected data
- **Results App** (Port 8082): Displays analytics and insights
- **MySQL Database**: Stores user and developer data
- **MongoDB**: Stores processed analytics data
